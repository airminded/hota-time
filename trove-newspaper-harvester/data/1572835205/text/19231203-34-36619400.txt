 20-KNOT LINERS. TO AUSTRALIA IN NINETEEN DAYS. From our Special Correspondent. It would need. Sir John Biles estimates, a subsidy of nearly half a million a year to make a 20-knot service between London and Sydney via Suez, possible. This would mean that mails could be landed in Fremantle in 19 days. London November 1, 1923. That well-known naval architect. Sir John Biles, has prepared a statement on the possibility of establishing a 20-knot service between the Motherland and Aus- in:!ii>.

In csthnatiug &lt;ie cost of such a service the freight rate as determined from a tJ'PKa! ship now running in the Australian trade, -was increased b\- 75 ipec cent, to al\>w for the consideration that the new Kiiips would carry only careo &lt;ll the highest Frade and to do so at efreater speed. It H-a* assumed that tiney would carry a three-fourths complement of pasaenfrom at, average fares of £lw and £i 2 10/ i?r cabin and stoarnae reapeotirely, and that thoy v.ovid run -wrth a nine-tenths X?d (if carj>o, on the (mound that there -sxhiH be m> di(Seul;.y in handling- the small total raiiount of oarjo, e?-en if the stay in port were very short.

Sir John Biles beb'e\-?s&lt; tliat i ?ach oi" the five sliijik fully employed wou.d lia,w to be subsidised to 1 the extent uf about £75^100 per annum. If the statin ship were to remain idle excel* for two Vrmi in the year, she would entail a sub sidy of ahom £139,000; but lie thinia; it reasonable to assume that lucrative cm ploj-ment could be found for h?- in special cruieeii, and that mi^ht .Justify tbe (sub sidy for her being a&wexd at £75.&lt;)00, as for the other five ships. Hence, the sub sidy for a tATO->*i?*lv service would be in the rosdon of £450.01W per annum. In considering these figores, however, it must be borne in mind, lie remarks, that the. cort of carryijvr tlie Australian ntiils is at present about £-360.000 pox annum, and that espendlturp is incurred on account nf assist^ po?Kic?i. Tlie cost of tlicse sen-ieee should be deducted from tie bu!> iidie* statM al*>ve, in oi-der to arrive at the cvpense of die accelerated senise. FinalK-. Sir John Biles ref?-s to two considerations of importance. One is the prwit srvpe for economy of operation af forded by reduction of the time spent in I?rt. The other is ihat^. while Kiie sus restei 70CMft. ship has been outlined on th* bssis Dihat l'tiel is taken on board at bwo intermediate porU (say Port Said and L"o;orr,V>) and water at one. if'fue! couM be takon on board at Fremantle in addi lion and water at two or three intermedi ate ports, the total d?ad weitrht to be liarrixi oouM be approciabir mlaced, and it might be possible to fulfil tbe main re nuiremenls xitb a ship rather smaller, and therefore cheaper than than the 700-ft. ship. The iaiportaure of fretting the smaller* capable chip lies in tbe fact that the charges on revenue that depend on Rr?t cost ar&lt;> much the largoat item, on [?He expenditure side, of tbe running ac count. ?
