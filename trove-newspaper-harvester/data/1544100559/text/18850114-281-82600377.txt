Those steamers havo been hitherto running in -tbo.:_Atlantic trade uudor tho Qaion flng, and havo won extraordinary fauio for tho rapidity of their passages, the Alaska being cnllod tbo ' greyhound of tbo Atlantic. , As it is understood that tho Gnion lino is on the eve of being ab sorbed in the Cunard Company, Poarco will resume his boats, and of cpiirso naturally.doairos a now sphoro for them wilh fair: promises of ultiniato success. Ho ..-states that bo would undcrtako to condnct a service between London nod Sydney in 28 days, nnd between London nnd Aucklnnd in 25. This be, would do for a subsidy of '£00,0.00 a year, if three colonies would become contribn tory to; tbo ox ton t of £lio,ooo each. As such a service would wholly eclipse "anything-''iha't is otherwise poseinlo botwpon the. Awstralasion colonies and England, tbo proposnl is otio that desorves serious consideration.

Mr. Poarco is '.largely concerned in tbo New Zealand Shipping Company, as -.w.oll as being tho ownur of ibouvo best boats of the San Francisco lino, it is not nulikoly that tho 'mail arrangements of , tho colony will shortly assume a- now and vory important phoso," /
