 THREE, DAYS' í; ALIGHT. ,. . -&lt; , , . ' LONDON TO SYDNEY.. Planes Now Being Built. MELBOURNE, Tuesday. Sir Donald.Banks, Permanent Under- secretary for Air in Great Britain and one of the three members of the British Air Mission to Australia, said to-day that aeroplanes able to cover the dis- tance between London and Sydney in three days were now being built in England. They were landplanes capable of a speed of 250 miles an hour, with a range of 2,000 miles. On such a service, he continued, the planes 1 would have to fly day and night and make only six calls during the trip, for refuelling. They, would be big enough - to accommodate 12 passengers day and night and mail. It was-not intended that this service should supersede the existing flying-boat service, which was both comfortable and popular. The new service would be used and recog- nised entirely as a special express tor pas- sengers and mail. Because of lack of planes it would not be possible, when the service was inaugurated, to maintain a regular ser- vice to a strict schedule. The type of plane to be used would have its first tests over the Atlantic from Croy- don (England) to America In about a year's time. It was suggested that the planes will be ready for the Australian service in 1942, Sir Donald Banks, who was accompanied by Lady Banks, left for England in the Or- ford to-day. He said that Australia had made more than satisfactory progress in all channels of Civil aviation._
