 London To Sydney in 'O &Ju-vs ^ LONDON, Thursday. It is not fantastic to say that, with night-flying, the air journey between England and Sydney could be reduced from nine days to three, says the 'Daily Telegraph' in a leading article today. Before long, the article says, the nine days now spent on the flight will be painfully slow. The Dutch service, it is pointed out, is already beating the British schedule times. The article concludes with tributes to Ross Smith, Kingsford Smith, T. Campbell Black, Jean Batten and A. E. Clouston as trail-blazers.
