OAVX COIUtESr-OXUEXT.; LONDON, Jin-e 4. A topic which has caused considerable annoyance to ' the Radical party relates to flogging in the army. Mr. ' Childers, the War Secretary, was asked a question on Ihe subject, and though his answer conveyed an assurance a9 to the Government being prepared to indorse the policy of Lord Hartington last year, the inclusion of the right hon. gentleman's speech indi- cated that the Government weie in no hurry to abolish Hogging. When he referred to the difficulty of find- ing a substitute for that form of punishment the lories cheered to the echo, and the impression left upan the House was that tho abolition of flogging in th& array, like the recall of Sir Bartle Frere, would not evoke any serious efforts for its realization. The Tory cheers only increased the indignation of the Radicals, whoso fury threatened to take shape in more *' round robins." In order to avert the conting storm, the Government resorted to another explanation. Mr. Shaw Lefevre, the Secretary to the Admiralty, was to have been questioned respecting the use of the lash in the navy. The hon. gentleman took the wind out of tho sails of his interlocutor, and sup- plemented Mr. Childers' short speecli by asking that the question should be postponed, becauso the Govern-' ment had the whole of the subject of the lash under consideration, and were only waiting to ascertain what ' other form of punishnment could be substituted. It consoled the Radicals to learn that upon the main point, viz., the abolition of flogging, the Government had absolutely made up their minds. .... There has also been considerable dissatisfaction with Ministers for their conduct of business in Parliament. ,We have had a long wrangle over the Bradlaugh case, and have not yet seen the end of it. If the Govern- ment had been careful to cover the wholo scope of this subject by tho first committee of inquiry, many of the ' diseussions which have since taken place and the appointment of a second committee might have beeu avoided. The Torie3 have made every effort to tarnish . the Government with all that is discreditable in regard to Bradlaugh. Sir Stafford Northcote and his ex official colleagues have not done much to embarrass the Government, for the work has been taken out of /their hands hy younger and more energetic men like Sir H. J). Wollf, Mr. A. Balfour, Jlr. Ritchie, and Mr. Gorst. These gay spirits make no secret of their intention to associate the Liberal party with Bradlaugh to the fullest possi- ble extent, and they have lost no chance of thwarting Mr. Bradlaugh's admission into the Hou=e. And, in truth, Mr. Bradlaugh deserved much that he has re- ceived. His whole conduct from beginning to end ha3 had one leading object, namely, to obtain his own noto- riety. If he had boen content to take the oath, like ,the late John Stuart Mill, no diiliculty would have been ijaised to such a proceeding ; and he further discredited himself by asserting, when he found that his claim to affirm would not be allowed, that he would take the oath. _is case was aggravated by a foolish work which ho had written some years ago, on " The ITou'e of llanover," which breathed hostility to the roigning dynasty. But it is not because of Mr. Bradlaugh's opinions on religion that tho House of Commons and the public a> e disposed to cavil at his admission into Parliament. Tho publication of such filthy works as the " Fruits of Philosophy," and his aggressive atheism for pecuniary objects, have led most people to hold him in profound contempt. For these reasons Mr. Bradlaugh has been denounced, on grounds entirely unconnected with the question of the oath, and it is very doubtful whether the new committee to whom the subject has been re- ferred will take a broader view of this subject than the House of Commons. The chief point tobe ascertained by "e committee relates to the force which Mr. Biadlaugh attaches to the oath of allegiance. In his examina '.ation before the committee he stated that he considered the words to be as complete and as binding upon his conscience as they were upon any other member. He declined to commit himself as regarding the taking of the oath in the light of an appeal to a Supreme Being. The committee are in a great difficulty. In order to report against Mr. Bradlaugh they will have to deal with the oath as in two parte ; an acknowledgment of allegiance, and an appeal to God. Seeing that Quakers and others have hitherto been allowed to affirm, that is, to abandon that portion of the oath relating to ..an appeal to the Supreme Being, it Avili bo exceed- ingly difficult for the committee to deprive Mr. Brad- laugh of asimilar right. The unpopularity of Mr.Brad- laugh's views on religion and morals is so intense that 'it is expected on all hands the committee will report against that gentleman being allowed to take the oath. The prevailing impression among the public is that the tfhst committee appointed to deal with this case ought to have permitted Mr. Bradlaugh to affirm. If the ^present committee allow neither oath nor affirmation the Government will be saddled with the responsibility of bringing in a bill to meet Mr. Bradlaugh's case. Tou may guess the unpopularity of such a ?tep among the religious classes of this country. Tor years " Iconoclast " has laboured in eveiy town and village to show up the " superstitions " of the Christian faith, and thousands of orthodox people regard him as the personation of the veritable Mephistopheles. The Government dare not make any serious attempt to pass such a measure for such a man. For any other sincere doubter of the Christian faith such a thing might have been possible, but for Brad- laugh-never. The House of Lords Avould oppose the bill from the first letter to the last. The measures of legislation proposed by the Govern- ment will considerably redeem their character in the eyes of those electors who hold extreme views. The Irish Franchise Bill is pretty sure to become law. The chief point in favour of it is, not the approval of English or Scotch opinion, which will dislike the quality of tho new voting power ia Ire- land under this measure, but the fact that the extension of the franchise is a leading plank of the liberal platform, and the extension iof the franchise in Ireland is a purely political sop. There is not one man in a thousand who does not con- | jider that the voting class in Ireland is already quite low enough in the scale of intelligence, and the best remedy for the country, in this respect, would be, not to lower the franchise, but to reduce the number of Irish constituencies. The quality of the men returned by Ireland to the present Parliament is almost appalling. They have little or no stake in the country, and many of them are selected because of their power of talking, and their vehement hatred ot the Saxon. Moreover, the iufluence of the priesthood in Ireland, especially among tho lower classes, was shown by the last election to be on the increase, and any extension of the franchise would virtually mean au extension of the power of the Church. But these considerations are of little avail. The Liberals are pledged to extend the Irish franchise, and their promise will have to be Mulled. The Burials Bill introduced by the Govern- ment is unquestionably a very good measure. It is a little remarkable that it should have been first of all , introduced into the House of Lords. One would have thought that Mr. Gladstone would not have sent it to the Upper Chamber till it had passed through the Commons, and havo received the largo majority in its favour which it will undoubtedly obtain there. That rten would have given the measure a certain amount st eclat which the Lords could not have well ignored. The Government, however, may have in- tended to " machine " the bill in this "fashion, to introduce it in the Lords first, in order that the Com- mons may havo the opportunity to amend any altera- tions which the Lords may propose 'in it, and send the bill back to the Upper Chamber in the dog-days when only official peers are present. The proposals of the Government apply to all classes of Christians, and sven to those who, as unbaptised, cannot claim church membership, or who aro actually excommunicated. There is a little difficulty as to the meaning of the measure in regard to Unitarians, but as a whole it may he described as a measure which onlv forbids ceremonial Avhich is not of a Christian character. It provides that a burial shall either be without any religious service, or Avith a Chris- tian and orderly service, and it proscribes no form which is calculated to embarrass tho Dissenters. Under this bill Jews, Mohammaden?, and infidels, and I believe Unitarians also, will have to be interred without religious seivice. The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Archbishop of York, and many of the Bishops, u well as many of the peers, have long eince realized the necessity of settling this burning question aä speedily as possible. They know well enough that it is but the outwork of disestablishment, and the heads of the Church are at last beginning to realize what the bulk of churchmen have long since felt, namely, that unless the grievances of the dissenters can he satisfactorily settled, and unless the Church earnestly reforms herself, the disestablishment will receive a very dangerous impetus. "We have had evidence on many hands of increasing wisdom in this respect, and the heads of the Church, and the feeling of surprise that the Bishop of Lincoln should have attempted to block the Avay of the Government bill is an illustration of their newly-found perspicacity. But Dr. "Words- worth's opposition was defeated in the Lords last night by a substantial majority. The attitude of the landlord class respecting the game laws is almost a parallel case. The Government have just brought in a measure which deals with ground game, that is, hares and rabbits." Under this bill, a tenant is afforded equal rights in ground game us the land law, and as that right is made inalienable, so that neither landlord nor tenant can contract himself out of the law, there is a prospect of the bill proving to he a practicable and useful measure. Such a proposal would never have been brought into Parliament by any other Government; aud the Peers would not pass it now but that landlords are alarmed at the irritation of their tenants. The first feeling in regard to this bill was that it would meet with little opposition, but a Ftvong under current is now setting in against it, chiefly on the ground that landlords may be induced to get rid of their tenants who exercise the rights confeired by this bill to such a completo extent as to interfere with the landlords' sport ; and the bill is also disliked because it contravenes the rights and the law of contract. Another measure, which is of some interest, and which has received the support of the Government, relates to the extension of the hours for polling. The bill, brought in hy a private member, was read a second time last night, and received the assistance of the Government bench. Pressure is also being brought to tear upon the Governient to assist the bill for legalising marriage with a deceased wife's sister, and to extend the provisions of the measure making employers liable for accidents to their workmen more favourable to the working classes than as at present, proposed. j I have oxhau3ted the leading subjects of interest in connection with our Parliamentary proceedings, but my reference to political matters would not be complete Avithout an allusion to the election of Sir William Harcourt for Derby. Sir "William lost his seat for Oxford undor circumstances which I have pre- vio! sly described. For some weeks he wandered houseless, Avhich is, at all times, degrading to a Cabinet Minister. In the end, Mr. Plimsoll chivalrously withdrew from the repre- sentation of Derby in order to lind him a place, and Sir William is once moro in the House of Commons, a wiser and a soberer-minded man. Contrasted with his violent speeches of the last few years, his attitude and his humility recall the historic example of Uriah Heap. His entry into the House of Commons, as he advanced to be sworn at the table, with hands meekly folded across his breast, was a sight for the gods-I mean the Tory gods-whoso life he has often made a perfect misery to them. The indignation of Exeter Hall and the Evangelical school against Mr. Gladstone for appointing Lord Kenmare to the post of Lord Chamberlain, and Lord Eipon to the Viee-Eoyalty of India, has been in no wise diminished. The Scotch Presbyterians, whose annual assemblies have just been sitting, hare joined in the cry, and though these proceedings seem like freaks of fanaticism, it is unquestionable that there is a very general feeling of dissatisfaction among other classes than Evangelicals for sending Lord Eipon to India. Even politicians are much divided in opinion, respect- ing this selection, because of the part Lord Bipon took as president of the Commission for settling the Ameri- can claims respecting the Alabama dispute. The memory of that transaction is just now being keenly brought home to us by the further claims of the United States in regard to the Canadian Fishery question. For the moment, however, it is not the present Viceroy of India who attracts the most attention here, but His predecessor. Lord Lytton seems to have made a terrible mess of the las*. Indian budget. The correspondence published this week upon that subject is highly damaging to his reputation ; and of all the servants of the Crown who endeavoured to cairy out the policy of the Beaconsfield Government, nono are so unpopular as the late Viceroy of India. The aspect of affairs in Afghanistan looks better than it did, because of the apparent willingness of Abdul Rahman to accept the rule of Cabul and Balkh. The negotiations with that prince are dragging some- what wearily, and the suspicion is now arising that Abdul Rahman is purposely delaying action in order to wait for inspiration from the Russians at Tashkent. The Government have made up their minds to with- draw fiom the country as speedily as possible. It is hardly an exaggeration to describe them as on their knees beseeching Abdul Rahman to relieve them of responsibility. If that prince is really disposed to act with loyalty towards us, and not willing to become a tool for Russian intrigue, it is generally regarded that his appointment as Ameer would be a good one.. But the Indian Government are grop- ing in the dark. Abdul Eahman is 150 miles away from Cabul, and the suspicion that he may still be not unfriendly to "his old patrons may have considerable justification. The be3t informed men here are begin- ning to regard his conduct with some anxiety, The most interesting events of the past fortnight with regard to foreign affairs relate to the steps which the Government are taking in order to compel Turkey to carry out the provisions of the Berlin Treaty. They are arranging for a confer- ence of ambassadors, who will meet about a month hence at Berlin, in order to bring united pressure upon Turkey. That Conference will chiefly have reference to the Greek question. At the present moment it is not known whether it will deal with the subject of internal reforms or with the Montenegrin diiliculty. Mr. Goschen has for eome days been at Constantinople ; and on his way thither he called at Paris and Vienna, in order to discuss these subjects with the Fiench and Austrian Governments, and, in Vienna, to remove the bad impression which had been produced by the imprudent language of Mr. Gladstone before his election for Mid- lothian respecting the intentions of Austria. When the Porte discovered a special em-oy, like Mr. Goschen, for such he is regarded, even though Sir Henry Layard has left his post, they wore in a stato of the utmost alarm. Said Pasha, known as " the Eng- lishman," was summoned from his govemship of Aleppo, in order, it was thought, to resume the rule Avith a new Ministry of reform, and to reintroduce Midhat Pasha's Turkish Parliament. The advisers of the Sultan met in Council, and virtually decided to throw up the sponge; but after the sitting was over, "little Said," the Grand Vizier, was once more able to thwart the recommendations of his colleagues. He induced the Sultan to cancel the Imperial order for his rival's return from Aleppo, and convinced his Majesty that Turkey had no reason to fear the action of England, because the jealousy of the. Powers would not enable England to exert more pressure upon Turkey than she has hitherto been able to effect. Meanwhile, Musurus Pasha, who has for thirty years been Turkish Ambas- sador in London, was sent for to Constantinople, in order to advise the Government as to the probable out* come of Mr. Gladstone's action. There is little doubt as to what Musurus will recommend to be done. He will thoroughly support the case of Europe as against his, own country, and Mr. Goschen will find him the best possible tuend he can have at Court. But what is to happen if Turkey declines to adopt the advice of united Europe? Will united Europe exer- cise compulsion ? It is difficult to believe that such will be the case. In fact, no one can form an opinion upon it. Mr. Goschen himself has no definite notions as to the course of his future policy, and as to what will happen after the presentation of a formal document from the representatives of the Towera at Constanti- nople, which is now being drafted, and which will demand the fulfilment of Turkish obligations. Nor can Mr. Gladstone himself suggest what is likely to result from the conference of Ambassadors on the Greek ques- tion, called under the 24th articleof the Berlin Treaty. Thelatest news from Constantinople seems to indicate that the Porte has taken up the position of passive resistance ; the Pashas assume it to be impossible that the Powers will resort to force, and they virtually admit that nothing but force can bring about a settlement of the Berlin arrangement to anv fuller degree than hat been already accomplished. Even if Mr. Gladstone succeeds in his spirited endeavour, lie will still have to settle with the Turkish Government- for those reforms in Asia Minor which are embraced within the Convention with this country, and which form no part of. tho Ber- lin settlement. I need hardly point out that the atti- tude of antagonism adopted by Mr. Gladstone, in respect of thr> provisions of the Ber- lin Treaty, is scarcely likely to encourage any efforts ho may malro in order to secure the fuliil meut of those measures which Turkey has pledged her- self to adopt under the Asia Minor Convention. Most people regard the outlook of the Eastern Question not only as exceedingly uncertain, but increasingly danger- ous. A single shot fired by an Albanian fanatic against the Montenegrins, who are lining the course of the Zem, in the hope of entering upon the ceded Albanian territory, might lead to a declaration of war by Monte- j negro against Turkey, and reopen the Eastern Question in all its gravest aspects. M. Leon Say has had hut a short stay as French Ambassador in London. When it was announced that he was coming hero as the representative of France, with the object, among other purposes, of arranging the new Anglo-Fienek Treaty, it was thought that some- thing would be done in regard to the wine duties. The British Government, however, can undertake no arrange- ments either in regard to the general tariff, or to the British wine duties, which will involve a sacrifice of revenue. Mr. Gladstone is understood to have said that for two years at least no financial concessions could be made, because of the muddle in which he had found the Imperial Exchequer in Downing Street. At the present moment, therefore, there seems to be no prospect of any remission of the wine duties. Before I close this letter Tmay be able to give you some further information on this subject as the result of a deputation which is to wait upon Mr. Gladstone this afternoon. Some of the members who will compose that deputation intend, if possible, to advocate the case of the colonies. The London season is now supposed to be at its height. The Derby has been 'run, and the favourite has won it ; but it is a dull season. The bad trade of the last two years has made its mark more effectually upon the gaiety of society than was the case twelve months ago. The squirearchy have had to mako so many concessions to their tenants, in the shape of remissions of rent, that they have had to put a serious limitation upon the fri- volities of their wives and daughters. The assembling of a new Parliament and the introduction of a number of new members, many of them of the manufacturing class, has introduced a new element into London salons, and to the Queen's drawing-rooms, hut it is not an aristocratic element, and slories of the faux pas of the mauvais riches constitute one-half the go;sip of London society. Sarah Bernhardt, the well-known member of the Coniedie-Franoaise lias quarrelled witli her col- leagues, and is now performing at the Gaiety Theatre, London, hut she has rendered herself liable to £1l',000 damages to the Comedie-Franoaise. She has also the I mortification of finding that the British public does not run after her so much on this occasion, as it did last year, and that the eccentricities of hev genius inspire more of contempt than of enthusiasm. Regardless of her example, another member of the Comedie-Frangaise, M. Coquelin, has al-o quarrelled with his colleagues in order to fulfil an engagement in London, and should he persist in leaving Paris in order to join Sarah Bernhardt, a heavy action will likewise be laid against him. Among the heroes of the week in fashionable circles may be mentioned the King of Greece, who has just arrived in this country, partly on a tour of relaxation, hut mainly to discuss with leading men hero the Turco Greek difficulty prior to the Conference at Berlin. The success of the Strathleven experiment has in- duced the Germans to send us frozen meat in com- petition with the home produce. Frozen carcases can bo brought from the Continent much cheaper than living beasts, but German meat is not good meat, and German mutton is an abomination. The quality of Australian meat will effectually stifle all the competition of the Teutons. The Duke of Connaught has been made a Major General, and the Prineo of Wales promoted to the colonelcies of three regiments of the Household Troops, all at once. Those promotions have given great offence. Thoy block, as in the ease of the Duke of Connaught, legitimate promotion, and excite the contempt of the German and other nations who really understand military subjects. From London'papera to the 4tk June we take tile following extracts : THE BURIALS BILL. Tha House of Lords was the scene, on June 3, of an animated party debate. The bubjeet was the Ministerial Burials Bul. the rejection of wliieh was moved by the Bishop of Lincoln. This measure is not, as it stand», completely satisfactory to any party in the State. The Tories and the High-Churchmen resist it as they would resist any legislation of the sort on the ground of principle. They hold that to sanction the interment of Dissenters in consecrated ground with any other rites than those ordained by the Church of England is to concede the first step in the crusade against the Establishment. On the other hand the Radicals are not quite content with the measure, because it fails to separate between the religious and secular rights of Englishmen, and because it enacts that no service except of a religious character shall be performed at the grave. Ultimately the success of the measure is certain, and probably pretty much in tho shape in which it now stands. Nor is there any reason to fear that its results will seriously jeopardise the Church of England as a national institution. On the contrary, one of its influences will probably be to prevent the party of reform within the pale of the Church making common causo with those who believe that the only possibilities of its reform lie in its destruction. _
